Hello.
This is a basic information retrieval system. It uses the classic TF*IDF algorithm.
Optimized by an inverted index and other niches.

In order to run this:
    1. pip install -r requirements.txt
    2. You also need to install nltk's 'stopwords'. To do so:
        a. Open terminal/command prompt (Depending on your OS of choice)
        b. Open python (usually by writing 'python', if you have it on your PATH env. variable) and run:
        >>> import nltk
        >>> nltk.download("stopwords")
